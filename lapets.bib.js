The application was developed specifically to support a Boston Women's Workforce Council (BWWC) study of the gender wage gap among employers within the Greater Boston Area. The application was deployed successfully to collect aggregate statistical data pertaining to compensation levels across genders and demographics at a number of participating organizations."

      "abstract": "The growing popularity of infrastructure-as-a-service cloud computing, software-defined networking, and related technologies have enabled the rapid creation of complex, large-scale distributed systems. Many of these systems are used by applications with stricter requirements than those covered by SLAs, such as those used by the financial, healthcare, and industrial sectors. Mathematical methods exist which can be used to formally verify many of these safety, liveness, and security properties, but are rarely used by system designers.  In this paper, we identify brittle requirements as one of the problems which impede the use of formal methods in distributed system design, and propose a solution based on the decomposition of a formal model into a user-defined component and one or more domain abstractions. This decomposition enables reusable requirements, which can be shared across models without requiring redefinition or remapping of variable bindings. We provide a network-based example of domain abstraction, and define reusable requirements over this abstraction in several well-known logics. We concretely implement model decomposition with VML, a lightweight modeling language based on labeled transition systems. VML models can be used to rapidly prototype new distributed systems by utilizing domain abstractions with reusable requirements. To demonstrate, we create two examples using imperative and symbolic VML models."

      "abstract": "Next generation cyber-physical systems (CPS) are expected to be deployed  in domains which require scalability as well as performance under  dynamic conditions. This scale and dynamicity will require that CPS  communication networks be programmatic (i.e., not requiring manual  intervention at any stage), but still maintain iron-clad safety guarantees. Software-defined networking standards like OpenFlow provide a means for scalably building tailor-made network architectures, but there is no guarantee that these systems are safe, correct, or secure. In this work we propose a methodology and accompanying tools for specifying and modeling distributed systems such that existing formal verification techniques can be transparently used to analyze critical requirements and properties prior to system implementation. We demonstrate this methodology by iteratively modeling and verifying an OpenFlow learning switch network with respect to network correctness, network convergence, and mobility-related properties. We posit that a design strategy based on the complementary pairing of software-defined networking and formal verification would enable the CPS community to build next-generation systems without sacrificing the safety and reliability that these systems must deliver."

      "abstract": "A large variety of SMT techniques and associated solvers have been developed by the formal modelling and verification communities. For a particular application domain, each technique has its own unique set of advantages and limitations. Within the context of a particular application domain (characterized by a particular set of possible logical formulas), the fitness of a technique can be characterized along multiple dimensions: expressiveness, soundness, completeness, response time, computational cost, and others. Furthermore, certain application domains may require that multiple techniques be used in concert in order to address the particular set of formulas that must be supported. We present a prototype lightweight integrated environment that incorporates four different cloud-hosted SMT solvers behind a single web-based interface: CVC3, Alt-Ergo, Yices, and Z3. Formulas submitted using a common logical syntax are translated into representations suitable for each of the underlying SMT solvers. We discuss the characteristics of each of the SMT solvers, in part by presenting the target syntaxes of the translations (including what outputs the solvers can produce and how this relates to their completeness with respect to the common syntax). We then discuss future directions, including the automated characterization of SMT solvers integrated into the infrastructure in terms of expressiveness, completeness, and response time."

      "abstract": "Formal methods are now a central component of computer-science education and research. However, there will always be advances in mathematical logic -- a.k.a. `formal methods' among computer scientists -- leading to advances in reliable, safe and secure computing. There are many research directions that will promote the impact of formal methods on computer science in significant and novel ways. We outline two directions, each associated with its own research challenges, that are complementary to the current state-of-the-art: one of composability and one of integration, each considered in a specific context drawn from our own recent research and teaching experience. We try to clarify why the study and ultimate resolution of these two challenges hold the promise of important breakthroughs in the accessability of formal methods and, ultimately, their applicability."

      "abstract": "In many information networks, data items -- such as updates in social networks, news flowing through interconnected RSS feeds and blogs, measurements in sensor networks, route updates in ad-hoc networks, etc. -- propagate in an uncoordinated manner: nodes often relay information they receive to neighbors, independent of whether or not these neighbors received such information from other sources. This uncoordinated data dissemination may result in significant, yet unnecessary communication and processing overheads, ultimately reducing the utility of information networks. To alleviate the negative impacts of this information multiplicity phenomenon, we propose that a subset of nodes (selected at key positions in the network) carry out additional information de-duplication functionality -- namely, the removal (or significant reduction) of the duplicative data items relayed through them. We refer to such nodes as filters. We formally define the Filter Placement problem as a combinatorial optimization problem, and study its computational complexity for different types of graphs. We also present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for the problem. Our experimental results, which we obtained through extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world information flow networks, suggest that in many settings a relatively small number of filters is fairly effective in removing a large fraction of duplicative information."

      "abstract": "NetSketch is a tool that enables the specification of network-flow applications and the certification of desirable safety properties  imposed thereon. NetSketch is conceived to assist system integrators in two types of activities: modeling and design. As a modeling tool, it enables the abstraction of an existing system so as to retain sufficient enough details to enable future analysis of safety properties. As a design tool, NetSketch enables the exploration of alternative safe designs as well as the identification of minimal requirements for outsourced subsystems. NetSketch embodies a lightweight formal verification philosophy, whereby the power (but not the heavy machinery) of a rigorous formalism is made accessible to users via a friendly interface. NetSketch does so by exposing tradeoffs between exactness of analysis and scalability, and by combining traditional whole-system analysis with a more flexible compositional analysis approach based on a strongly typed, Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to specify network configurations at various levels of sketchiness along with invariants that need to be enforced thereupon. In this paper we discuss a first implementation of the NetSketch system. We begin with a brief introduction to the NetSketch concept and formalism, and then discuss the methodology behind the type generation process as well as the technical implementation of the overall system. In a companion paper, we define the formal system underlying the operation of NetSketch, in particular the DSL behind NetSketch's user interface when used in sketch mode, and prove its soundness relative to appropriately-defined notions of validity."

The mapping between what constitutes desirable performance and SLAs is not unique: multiple SLA expressions might be functionally equivalent. Having the flexibility to transform SLAs from one form to another in a manner that is provably safe would enable hosting solutions to achieve significant efficiencies. This paper demonstrates the promise of such an approach by proposing a type-theoretic framework for the representation and safe transformation of SLAs. Based on that framework, the paper describes a methodical approach for the inference of efficient and safe mappings of periodic, real-time tasks to the physical and virtual hosts that constitute a hierarchical scheduler. Extensive experimental results support the conclusion that the flexibility afforded by safe SLA transformations has the potential to yield significant savings."

      "abstract": "The usability of verification systems is becoming increasingly important, and the effective integration of ontologies of formal facts (definitions, propositions, and syntactic idioms) into machine verification systems will likely play a role in improving the usability of such systems. The Aartifact lightweight verification system utilizes an ontology of formal propositions in order to support lightweight verification of formal arguments that involve common mathematical concepts. The ontology is stored within a relational database, and can be assembled and extended using a simple web interface by contributors who are domain experts. The database can be compiled into two separate components of the Aartifact system: a verifier component that computes congruence closures of expressions containing relations and predicates found in the ontology, and a JavaScript application that interactively presents to users information about the constants, operators, relations, predicates, syntactic constructs, and idioms found in the ontology (and, thus, supported by the verifier). In this way, the database serves to improve both the verification system's capacity to infer implicit applications of logical propositions within a user's formal argument, and to inform users in a context-aware and structured manner of the verification system's capabilities and limitations."

The Aartifact system's multi-faceted interactive user interface combines several approaches to user-friendly interface design: (1) a familiar and natural syntax based on existing conventions in mathematical practice, (2) a real-time keyword-based lookup mechanism for interactive, context-sensitive discovery of the syntactic idioms and semantic concepts found in the system's database of propositions, and (3) immediate validation feedback in the form of reformatted raw input. The system's natural syntax and database of propositions allow it to meet a user's expectations in the formal reasoning scenarios for which it is intended.

As a result, usability is becoming increasingly important in the design of formal verification tools.

The system is a prototype for investigating potential techniques for improving the usability of formal verification systems. It leverages techniques drawn both from existing work and from our own efforts. In addition to a parser for a familiar concrete syntax and a mechanism for automated syntax lookup, the system integrates (1) a basic logical inference algorithm, (2) a database of propositions governing common mathematical concepts, and (3) a data structure that computes congruence closures of expressions involving relations found in this database. Together, these components allow the system to better accommodate the expectations of users interested in verifying formal arguments involving algebraic and logical manipulations of numbers, sets, vectors, and related operators and predicates. We demonstrate the reasonable performance of this system on typical formal arguments and briefly discuss how the system's design contributed to its usability in two case studies."

These can include common tools for reasoning about systems of constraints of various classes (such as linear constraints, quadratic constraints, and so on), as well as logical systems and ontologies that deal with concepts relevant to the application domain. We integrate the Aartifact \\cite{BUCS-TR-2009-015} lightweight automated assistant for formal reasoning (which has also been applied in proving the soundness of the NetSketch formalism \\cite{BUCS-TR-2009-030}) as a tool for modeling and designing individual network components. We present use cases within the context of an example application of the NetSketch DSL that demonstrate how the automated assistant provides NetSketch users with both an interface for reasoning formally about constraints, and a straightforward way to implicitly employ a rich domain-specific ontology of logical propositions. This allows users to verify common properties of constraints and constraint sets, and to reason about constraint relationships using automatically verifiable algebraic manipulations."

However, broad accessibility has not been a priority in the design of formal verification tools that can provide these benefits. We propose a few design criteria to address these issues by drawing on our own reasoning as well as that of existing work: (1) a simple, familiar, and conventional concrete syntax that is independent of any environment, application, or verification strategy; (2) extensive native support for at least basic constructions and practices related to logical reasoning, arithmetic, naive set theory, algebraic manipulation, and evaluation of simple functions; and (3) a lightweight underlying structure that reduces workload and entry costs by allowing users to employ features selectively and by automatically managing multiple logical systems without requiring a user's involvement or technical knowledge. We demonstrate the feasibility of satisfying these criteria by presenting our own formal representation and verification system. Our system's simple concrete syntax overlaps with English, LATEX and MediaWiki markup. The system's underlying verifier demonstrates our main contributions. It relies on heuristic search techniques, data structures, syntactic analyses, and normal forms to make the proof authoring process more manageable and consistent with prevailing practices. Furthermore, its underlying logic consists of a symbolic template that enables lightweight verification but can also be used to automatically manage multiple logical systems through straightforward syntactic restrictions."

We demonstrate how this language can be used to combine both primitive and user-defined combinators, allowing it to capture a collection of basic truthful allocation algorithms.
